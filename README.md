# Context
This project was made as my final project for my Engineering Computing course. This course was a mechanical engineering course that I took when I was still double-majoring in ME. I had taken several computer science courses at this point, but this one offered the unique aspect of a graphics library that I could use, so I wanted to make something cool and challenging, even though the requirements were pretty relaxed.

# Overview
With the opportunity to use a graphics library, my mind gravitated towards a video game. I decided to make an interpretation of the popular arcade game called Pop-A-Shot. In the game, the player is given a certain amount of time to make as many basketballs into a mini-hoop as they can until the time expires. My program also has a game mode that is timed, in addition to a best-of-ten mode.

# Running
This program was developed using the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics IDE that can be found here: Windows: `https://www.kipr.org/kipr/hardware-software/kiss-ide-windows` Mac OS X: `https://www.kipr.org/kipr/hardware-software/kiss-ide-mac-os-x`. This IDE gives access to the graphics library that I used to design the game. To my knowledge, unfortunately, there is no way to open projects from the file system within the IDE, at least the version I was using. Instead, I made a video `Pop-A-Shot.mp4` with commentary that shows the program running and describes how I implemented things. The source code is also included for reference.
